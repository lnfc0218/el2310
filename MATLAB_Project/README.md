1. './images':
- stores all the test images provided for this course;
- images renamed for easier programming.
2. './data':
- stores all the parameters in .mat files.
3. './results':
- stores intermediate and final results;
- can be generated by running those demo files(seen below).





Demos

    DemoLoop: 

		Provide a direct demostration for the traditional loop method
		Each image can run forhundreds or thousands of seconds, better use a workstation to test it

    DemoMat: 
		Provide a direct demostration for the matrix method
		 Each image will only run for seconds or tens of seconds, so no need to run on workstation



Main function

	MainLoop: 
		uses the traditional method proposed in the MatlabProject file
		contains a lot of for loops, therefore can be extremely slow
		more accurate than the matrix method
		can handle larger radius range than the matrix method

	MainMat:
		uses a fast method proposed in an essay
		uses multidimensional arrays instead of for loops to speed up
		runs in seconds, instead of thousands of seconds for for loop ones

Sub function

	ReadImage:
		Read RGB image and turn it into gray for future processing
		the input can only be path or filename
		no need to turn the result into double float, since imfilter is compatible to uint8

	EdgeDetection: 
		use Sobel filters to detect edge
		choose a suitable threshold for both speed and accuracy

	LoopHT:
		use traditional Hough transform and a lot of for loops
		threshold can be low compared with the matrix method

	MatHT:
		use a fast matrix method to speed up

	DetectCircles:
		use the detected centers and radii to draw circles on the original RGB image


Pre-experiment

	PreExperiment_Radius: 
		uses MATLAB built-in function to detect the radii of all circles in a image, therefore narrow down the range and speed up computation. 
		The range result is saved as .mat file and can be good reference for dealing with separate images
		The function cannot detect anything for the 8th image, though there has to be some pre-processing method for this.
